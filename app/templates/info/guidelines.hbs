  <h1>Guidelines</h1>
  <p>Wordset is a structured dictionary. As such, we try to follow these guidelines to create a standardized resource. Our overall goal is usability.</p>
  <h2>Overall</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Kindness</em>: We strive to be a kind community. Be nice and helpful to people, even if you're frustrated. Give constructive feedback on proposals and explain why you are rejecting a proposal if that’s the case.</li>
      <li><em>Originality</em>: Do not copy directly from any other dictionaries or sources. Other dictionaries are often strictly licensed, and it's our aim to build a unique and novel online dictionary.</li>
      <li><em>Sourced</em>: Give sources for proposals where possible and appropriate. Especially when suggesting new words or meanings, a source for your proposal is essential. Examples of good sources include nationally recognized newspapers, magazines, and academic publications.</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Meanings and Examples</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid the use of gendered pronouns. Instead of using "he" or "she," employ the singular "they.” For example, "They tried sushi for the first time." There is significant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they">historical precedent</a> for this usage.</li>
      <li>Avoid the passive voice where possible. For example, "The dog chased the cat," is better than "The cat was chased by the dog."</li>
      <li>Start example sentences with a capital letter and end sentences with appropriate punctuation.</li>
      <li>Start all verb definitions with the word “to.” For example, the definition of hurt might read, “to cause damage or pain…”</li>
      <li>Try to provide context in example sentences. For example, if you are defining the word umbrella, “I like umbrellas,” is a bad example sentence; somebody who doesn't know what the word umbrella means would have a difficult time guessing what the word means based off of that example sentence. Instead, try sentences such as, “When it was raining, I grabbed my gray umbrella to shield myself from the equally gray conditions outside.”</li>
      <li>Avoid parenthetical citations. They break up definitions and often indicate unessential or extraneous information.</li>
      <li>Use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma">Oxford comma</a>. For example, write “I want to buy a calculator, a book, and a pencil,” as opposed to writing, “I want to buy a calculator, a book and a pencil.”</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Words and Phrases</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Avoid adding phrases or groups of words that are merely "X+Y" definitions. These dictionary entries are comprised of string of texts can be defined by defining each individual part of the entry. For example, "young boy" would be a bad dictionary entry or phrase to add since its definition would just be a combination of the definitions for "young" and "boy." </li>
    <li>Our goal is to create a dictionary, so avoid adding words or phrases that belong in an encyclopedia, almanac, or any otherwise resource that isn't a dictionary. For example,  Streptococcus pneumoniae does not belong in a dictionary. </li>
  </ul>
