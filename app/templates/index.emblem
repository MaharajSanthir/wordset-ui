  h1 Welcome to the first collaborative, structured dictionary.

  p WordSet is the first dictionary that you can edit that uses the highly-structured syntax necessary for a usable set of definitions.

  p Search for a word above to find a definition.

  p If you want to help collaborate on the dictionary, #{link-to 'register' | create an account}. We're always looking for suggestions of new words, changes to definitions, or sample quotes.

  p We're a team who thinks that most dictionaries are lacking something â€“ the relevance that comes from community input. We also believe that a dictionary, in order to be useful, needs to have a highly-structured layout backed by an API. We've brought these ideas together to form WordSet.
